======================
AG Preprocessor Brain — deterministic offline processing layer.

WHAT THIS IS
------------
The Preprocessor Brain sits in front of AG's LLM brains (Local Brain /
Cloud Brain) and handles the requests that do NOT require an LLM at all:

    - "What are your capabilities?"          (self-info)
    - "What is my current directory?"        (directory)
    - "Read brain.py."                       (directory)
    - "Create a file called X and write: Y"  (directory)

It is NOT an LLM, NOT a chatbot, and NOT a replacement for the Local or
Cloud Brain. It is a fast, offline, deterministic classifier/parser/
executor that either:

    (a) handles the request completely on its own and returns a
        structured, machine-readable result, or
    (b) declares that it cannot handle the request and that deeper LLM
        reasoning is required (``requires_llm=True``).

THE CORE PRINCIPLE
-------------------
    LLM:            "Here is what I think the user means."
    Preprocessor:   "Here is the structured operation I recognize."
    Local subsystem:"Here is what actually happened."
    AG:             "Here is the human-readable response."

The Preprocessor Brain is the middle two steps. It NEVER lets an LLM
perform or claim to perform a filesystem action, and it NEVER guesses
at a dangerous/irreversible operation from a weak signal — when it is
not confident, it says so (UNKNOWN + clarification) instead of acting.

SCOPE OF THIS FILE (Phase 1 — first five features only)
---------------------------------------------------------
    1. Self-capability / self-info processing   -> CapabilityRegistry
    2. Request classification                   -> RequestClassifier
    3. Intent detection                          -> IntentDetector
    4. Command parsing (NL -> structured command) -> CommandParser
    5. Directory control integration              -> DirectoryOperations /
                                                       DirectoryOperationExecutor

Everything else described in the Preprocessor Brain design doc (path
resolution as its own layer, device control, LLM request preparation,
etc.) is intentionally OUT of scope for this file and is left as
clearly-marked extension points.

INTEGRATION
-----------
AG (or ag_pipeline.py) is expected to eventually do something like::

    processor = PreprocessorBrain(directory_control=existing_directory_control,
                                   introspection_source=existing_introspection_engine)
    result = processor.process(user_input)

    if result.requires_llm:
        # fall through to Local/Cloud Brain as today
        ...
    else:
        # result.success / result.result / result.error is the truth
        ...

If no real ``DirectoryControl`` instance is supplied, a minimal, fully
self-contained fallback (``DirectoryOperations``) is used instead so
that this module can be developed, run, and tested completely on its
own (see the ``__main__`` block at the bottom of this file) without
importing anything from the rest of the AG codebase.

DESIGN RULES
------------
- No LLM calls anywhere in this file. No network calls. No shell
  commands. pathlib / stdlib only.
- Never raises out of the public API — every internal error becomes a
  PreprocessorResult with success=False and a structured error code.
- Error domains are kept separate (SELF_INFO / DIRECTORY /
  PREPROCESSOR / FILESYSTEM), mirroring AG's existing
  fallback_classifier.py error-isolation principle, so a failed
  filesystem operation can never be mistaken for a brain failure.
- Windows and POSIX paths both work (pathlib-based); no Linux-only
  assumptions, no shell-outs.

# a minimal, self-contained fallback implementation is provided below.
# It is intentionally NOT a competing architecture — same method
# surface, pure pathlib, single active-workspace model — so swapping in
# the real DirectoryControl later is a drop-in replacement with zero
# changes to the rest of this file.
