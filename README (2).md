# AG — Ambient Guidance

A context-aware personal operating assistant. Not a chatbot, not a smart
speaker — a local-first executive layer that routes between local and
cloud reasoning, remembers what matters, and tracks its own conversations
and tasks.

Current version: **v0.29+ / AG Beta build-out**

## What AG actually is

AG is built in layers, each with one job:

```
USER
  ↓
Conversation Manager   (tracks topic/thread, resolves "it"/"that"/"all this")
  ↓
Working Memory         (session-only context: current topic, discussion buffer)
  ↓
Executive Layer        (decides what's needed before answering: Planning + Context Analysis)
  ↓
Cognitive Engine        [PLANNED]
  ↓
Memory / Tasks / Projects  ←→  Brain Selection (Local / Cloud / Auto)
  ↓
Mood & Delivery          [PLANNED]
  ↓
Final Response
```

The Cognitive Engine sits *before* the Brain in the target architecture:
Working Memory decides what AG needs to know, the Cognitive Engine (once
built) decides what kind of understanding should exist, and only then does
the Brain generate language.

## Build status

| Stage | Module | Status |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Core (Brain Layer) | ✅ Complete |
| 2 | Memory | ✅ Complete |
| 3 | Project Context | ✅ Complete |
| 4 | Tasks | ✅ Complete |
| 5 | Executive Layer | 🟡 Partial (Storage/Category/Brain Routing/Planning/Context Analysis done) |
| 6 | Working Memory | 🟡 Phase A complete, Phase B (expanded cognitive workspace) architected, not yet built |
| 7 | Cognitive Engine | ⬜ Planned |
| 8 | Mood Engine | ⬜ Planned |
| 9 | Interface (Matrix UI) | ⬜ Planned |
| 10 | Input (Voice + Vision) | ⬜ Planned |
| 11 | Automation | ⬜ Planned |

Plus, built alongside the core pipeline as the **AG Beta infrastructure layer**:

| Module | Status |
|---|---|
| Probe Simulator | ✅ Phase A — deterministic risk/outcome simulation before actions |
| Schema Processor | ✅ Phase A — normalizes/validates all AG document types |
| Storage Manager | ✅ Phase A — schema-aware JSON document persistence |
| Index Manager | ✅ Phase A — keyword/tag/entity search indexes |
| Control Layer | ✅ Phase A — Brain Registry + Authorization Manager |
| Conversation Manager | ✅ Phase A — topic tracking, reference resolution, pending state |

**Build order:** finish Executive → Working Memory (expanded) → Cognitive Engine
(kept to a few concrete mechanisms, not a dashboard) → Mood → Interface/Input/Automation.

**AG Beta finish line:** Executive complete, Working Memory complete, Cognitive
Engine complete, Mood Engine complete, Matrix UI/Voice/Vision/Spatial complete.

**AG Alpha (after Beta):** no new subsystems — improve the brain itself
(reasoning, prediction, planning, learning, autonomy).

### Design principles this project holds itself to

- **One cohesive subsystem = one runtime file.** Split into a package only
  if a file exceeds ~700–1000 meaningful lines, migrations become
  substantial, or a single file becomes genuinely hard to maintain.
- **Incremental patches over full rewrites.** Changes are reviewed as
  diffs against the existing file, not regenerated from scratch.
- **Standard library only** for every Beta infrastructure module
  (Schema Processor, Storage/Index Manager, Control Layer, Conversation
  Manager, Probe Simulator) — no external dependencies, fully
  deterministic, no LLM calls inside any of them.
- **Layers don't duplicate responsibility.** Storage Manager owns
  persistence; Index Manager owns retrieval; Schema Processor owns
  validation; Control Layer owns permissions/brain selection — never
  both.

## Running AG

```bash
python Ag.py
```

Type naturally. A few structural commands:

| You say | AG does |
|---|---|
| `switch to cloud brain` | Permanently changes the default brain mode |
| `use cloud brain for briefing about all this` | Uses cloud for this one request only, then restores your default |
| `save last response` | Manually store the most recent brain answer |
| `shutdown` / `exit` / `bye` | Ends the session — if there's an unsaved discussion, AG asks once before storing it |

---

## Running tests

Each Beta module is tested standalone, no pytest required (plain asserts):

```bash
python test_probe_simulator.py
python test_schema_processor.py
python test_storage_index.py
python test_control_layer.py
python test_conversation_manager.py
```

All tests run against temporary/isolated data — none of them touch your
real `memory.json`, `tasks.json`, or `data/` directory.

## What's next

1. **Working Memory Phase B** — expand beyond topic/thread tracking to own
   current objective, current task, a reasoning scratchpad, retrieved-memory
   caching, a decision cache, and a unified `build_context()` — the active
   cognitive workspace between Conversation Manager and the (future)
   Cognitive Engine.
2. **Cognitive Engine** — a small number of concrete reasoning mechanisms
   (pattern recognition, causal reasoning, self-verification), not a
   ten-meter dashboard of unimplemented capability labels.
3. Eventually wire Conversation Manager, Working Memory, and Executive
   together as the single source of conversational truth, with Storage
   Manager / Index Manager / Schema Processor / Control Layer underneath
   as the persistence and safety layer.
