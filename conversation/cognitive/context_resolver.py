==============================
AG Phase 2 — ContextResolver

The ContextResolver is the second pipeline stage.  It runs after the
CognitiveEvaluator has populated the Thought and before the Brain is called.

Its sole responsibility is to produce a complete, unambiguous
``thought.resolved_input`` — the prompt the Brain will actually receive.

The Brain should NEVER receive an ambiguous question.

Responsibilities
----------------
1. Inspect WorkingMemory for active entities, topics, and history.
2. Identify the most likely referent for any reference words detected by
   the CognitiveEvaluator.
3. Rewrite the input to replace references with explicit content.
4. Score the resolution using the ConfidenceEngine.
5. If confidence is high  → rewrite automatically.
   If confidence is low   → mark the Thought to ask the user.
6. Log every decision in the Thought's reasoning_log.

Design principles
-----------------
- NEVER generates responses. Output is always a rewritten prompt string.
- NEVER uses hardcoded pronoun lists for matching. It detects that a
  reference slot needs filling (from the Thought's ``missing_information``),
  then looks for a candidate in context.
- Works entirely from the Thought + ConversationContext / EntityRegistry
  passed in by WorkingMemory.  No direct imports of Ag.py.

Example
-------
    Input:  "Where did he work?"
    Context entities: [Albert Einstein (confidence=0.95, last mentioned 1 turn ago)]
    Output: "Where did Albert Einstein work?"
    Confidence: 0.88
