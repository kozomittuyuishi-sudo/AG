==========================
Self-Info Query Router

Classifies an incoming user query as a self-info query and determines
which part of the self-model is most relevant to answer it.

Design rules:
- No LLM calls. Pure string matching + keyword heuristics.
- Returns a QueryRoute with a category and optionally a sub-topic.
- is_self_info_query() is the gate — returns True only for queries
  that the Self-Info system should own.
- Stdlib only.
